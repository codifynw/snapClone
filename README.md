# Full Stack Interview

This is a Cameo full stack interview, focusing more heavily on front end. This interview is flexible, and intends to simulate an environment you would normally code in.

The app skeleton is a typescript create-react-app, but supports standard javascript as well. This skeleton is also un-opinionated, meaning the patterns established in the skeleton do not assume to be right or even good.

`npm i`

`npm start`

### Dependencies
Only known gotcha is that you need to be running a node `version >= 9.0.0`
